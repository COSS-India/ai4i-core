# Service API Docs Registry
# Each service has one OpenAPI spec file (YAML or JSON) in this specs/ folder.
# The Docs Manager merges them into a single Swagger UI.
#
# api_gateway_url: base URL for proxy (e.g. http://localhost:8080)
# For deployed envs where the gateway has no /api-proxy route, set USE_API_PROXY=false
# so "Try it out" calls API_GATEWAY_URL directly.
